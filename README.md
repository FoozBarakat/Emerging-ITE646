****Predicting Forest Fires with Machine Learning****

This project aims to predict forest fires using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project contains various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, which are used to predict the occurrence of forest fires.

**Overview**:

- **Data Preparation**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for modeling.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset is analyzed to understand the relationships between different variables and gain insights into the factors influencing forest fires.

- **Modeling**: Several machine learning models, including Linear SVC, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, are trained and evaluated to predict forest fires based on the environmental factors.

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The models are fine-tuned using techniques like RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to improve their performance.
